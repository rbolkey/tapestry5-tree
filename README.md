# Tapestry 5 Nested Tree Tutorial

This project provides the source code used in the tutorial on my blog: 
[Building a contextual recursive tree in Tapestry 5](http://blog.bolkey.com/2009/06/tapestry-5-recursive-tree/).

The tutorial provides an example of how to build up a nested tree of Tapestry components where the components
may recursively call themselves.
